# Concurrent and Parallel Pipelines in Go

This repository contains the code that goes along with a blog post about concurrent and parallel pipelines in Go.

If you go back to the initial commit you can follow along the blog post. There's one commit for each important chapter and paragraph. Most of the commits can be run with any recent Go version, but the later chapters that use generics require at least Go 1.17.

If you have Nix installed you can make use of the provided flake with `nix develop`
